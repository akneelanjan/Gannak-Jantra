## Basic Calculator in C
### KOSS TASK

This program is a basic calculator in C. It has many functionalities of a calculator;
including trignometric and logarithmic functions. The program has a menu driven operation's table.

#### Also, the best part of the program is that it retains the previously evaluated result which can 
#### be used for further calculation. 

I have also uploaded the screenshots of a typical run of the program.

##### Also, I have uploaded my previous projects of a Web Calculator and my-made website of my favourite club Liverpool in VBScript.
