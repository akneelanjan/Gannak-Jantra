## Basic Calculator in C
### KOSS TASK

This program is a basic calculator in C. It has many functionalities of a calculator;
including trignometric and logarithmic functions. The program has a menu driven operation's table.

#### Also, the best part of the program is that it retains the previously evaluated result which can 
#### be used for further calculation. 

I have also uploaded the screenshots of a typical run of the program.

##### Also, I have uploaded my previous projects of a Web Calculator in VBScript and my-made website of my favourite club Liverpool in HTML/CSS.
Note: As VBScript is obsolete, so it runs only in Internet Explorer(versions older than IE11).
